# Kiosk Scanner

During the Minor 'Exclusive Design', together with a group I came up with the concept 'Kiosk Scanner'. This concept is designed exclusively for a specific person who can see 0,3%, but could also be used by people with less of a visible ability. The idea is that this person can type what they want to buy in the Kiosk, a small supermarket to-go located at several NS train station around the Netherlands. The app will make an effecient route and direct the person to the right products. Holding the camera out on the shelves, the app will show the user where they can find the product they're looking for.

We made use of the fact that this person can still see a little bit. This makes it possible for them to follow a visible route on their phone existing of circles. Some point we have paid extra attention on during this product were:

- Accessability
- Humor
- Identity
