# Kiosk Scanner

During the Minor 'Exclusive Design', together with a group I came up with the concept 'Kiosk Scanner'. This concept is designed exclusively for a specific person who can see 0,3%, but could also be used by people with less of a visual disability. The idea is that this person can type what they want to buy in the Kiosk, a small supermarket to-go located at several NS train station around the Netherlands. The app will make an effecient route and direct the person to the right products. Holding the camera out on the shelves, the app will show the user where they can find the product they're looking for.

We made use of the fact that this person can still see a little bit. This makes it possible for them to follow a visible route on their phone existing of circles. Some points we have paid extra attention on during this product were:

- Accessability
- Humor
- Identity

You can access the prototype [right here](https://emmabons.github.io/kioskscanner/). Make sure you watch it on a mobile device, as it was not designed to be displayed and used on a desktop device. If you have no visual disability, make some time to test it with your eyes (almost) closed, and the screenreader on your phone turned on to fully experience the app in the way it was designed.
